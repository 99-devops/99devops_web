Hello everyone, I wanted to share some interesting things that happened to me in the workplace. I am sure this has happened to you guys as well.

After I joined Audinate, I have been given the chance to sit in interview candidates who had applied for the position of Senior DevOps Engineer with more years of experience than me. Being from Nepal, we are not given chance to take, or even sit in the interview process. The perception is engineer cannot interview other candidates who have more experience than them. I had the same perception as well before joining here. I used to think the same, but I found it's different here. I have worked in the workplace when I was not even asked to join stand-ups as I was working part-time and told it's the organization policy. This does 3 things to the person:

Creates segregation.
Removes the feeling of being part of a team.
Diminishes productivity eventually.
Right after I joined Audinate, during every interview, I was asked to sit in an Interview for any candidate whether it's senior or mid or junior. I was hesitant at first but eventually, I got used to it. It's good to see what happens on the other side of the recruitment process as I always was on the interviewee side.

It was curious to me why they are doing so? then my one of the good dear friend/colleague Paul, a senior engineer in my company got back to me saying "Prabesh, You will be spending every day 8 hours working with him/her, you need to be assured that person is culturally and technically fit to work with you. the key is finding someone whom you would enjoy working with - it does not matter if they a super-smart if no one can work with them, it's best not to pick them".

This has changed my perception of how I used to see things, and actually think this is correct from what I have experienced so far and also would definitely follow this process and encourage behavior throughout my life.

This was a great experience for me and wanted to share it with you guys. I encourage if possible do this in your workplace as well, as this is effective, really really effective. It not only creates a sense of ownership, but it also makes people feel appreciated and inclusive in their workplace. It creates a positive environment and also removes the chance of hiring toxic personalities.
